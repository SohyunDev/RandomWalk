# RandomWalk

A cockrach is placed on a given square in the middle of a tile floor 
in a rectangular room of size nXm tiles. 
The bug wanders randomly from tile to tile throughout the room. 
Assuming that he may move from his present tile to any of the eight tiles
surrounding him with equal probability, 
how long will it take him to touch every tile on the floor at least once?

(1) Handle all values of n and m, 2<n<=40, 2<=m<=20
(2) Have an iteration limit, that is a maximum number of squares 
that the bug may enter during the experiment.
This ensures that my program will terminate.
A maximum of 50,000 is appropriate for this exercise.
